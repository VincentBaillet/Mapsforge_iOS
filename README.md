Mapsforge_iOS
=============

This is Objective-C analog for some part of Mapsforge library for Android, which you can find there: http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/ MapsforgeReader allows iOS applications to read compact .map files with vector maps. It's current state is very dirty, but it is working, and in time I would clear the code and write a specification on using this reader. If you are interested, you could directly contact me for description. Special thanks to java2objc tool (http://code.google.com/p/java2objc/), that have done some of routine work with code.
